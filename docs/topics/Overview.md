- **Zero trust (ZT)** is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. ^[1]
- **Zero trust architecture (ZTA)** defines the implementation of the zero trust principles in an enterprise environment.

Zero trust focuses on protecting resources and assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets based solely on their physical or network location (e.g. local network zone vs. internet). Further, zero trust assumes that a hacker is already on the network. Primarily, ZT is focused on data and service protection but can be expanded to include all enterprise assets (devices, infrastructure components, applications, virtual and cloud components) and subjects (end users, applications and other non-human entities that request information from resources).

A zero trust architecture is designed to prevent data breaches and limit internal lateral movement. 

ZT is not a single architecture but a set of guiding principles for workflow, system design and operations that can be used to improve the security posture.
